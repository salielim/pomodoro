The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

In this app the user can start a 25 minute pomodoro and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed. The length of each pomodoro can be customised and the clock can be reset for the userâ€™s next pomodoro.
